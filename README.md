### Problem Identified

People do not know what is in at an op shop until they go in there, and most of the time you need to browse in several stores until you find a desired product. For convenience people trend to go to bigger op shops, which normally belong to a chain of stores, leaving only a small portion of the market share for the community stores. Due to the limited market presence and visibility, those smaller op shops sometimes end up not having enough volume of sales to become a sustainable business that continuous to support the local economy and the underprivileged customers.

### Purpose

This web application has the main purpose of giving a better market visibility to small op shops by displaying their catalogue of products to be easily accessed by their customers, who can verify online if their local store has the items they are looking for and complete the purchase for pick up, saving time and money in their purchasing process, as it eliminates the need to physically go and browse for an item in several different stores.

### Target Audience

* Customers - local community, underprivileged people
* Small op shops - administrator and general staff
